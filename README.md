# daily-algo-practices

This repo is all about daily algo practicing.

My journey to do this daily started on Monday 8th January 2024.

The objective is to keep practicing what I have learned from trying to master javascript.

This repo contains my daily algo practices to keep my brain and knowledge fresh.

The starting set of algos come from the 70+ Javascript challenges created by Traversy Media.

Traversy Media have compiled a great resource here and every challenge is explained.

I am also including any algo challenges I spot during my daily persual of various social media sites.

To be clear: I am not the source of these challenges.

I am pulling them into so that I can practice.

The first couple of weeks the challenges are quite simple.
